# BTC Signal, Assessing Risk and Updates

**Welcome Avatar!** If you’ve been investing for years, you probably know that psychology is one of the most important things when evaluating investment opportunities and risk. With BTC at all time highs the risk has actually \*increased\* on holding the asset. Psychologically though, people will believe it is safer because it’s _“up a lot”_ so they should go all in.

If we were to summarize the sentiment right now related to crypto, we still think we’re around attention phase since the majority have the following vibe _“Coulda Shoulda Woulda”._ This means people are sidelined hoping for a dip.

_Conclusion? To us it means exactly as stated, we go higher but we’ll enter mania phase in 2025 with people levering up and chasing hard._

## Part 1: BTC Signal

Despite being overweight ETH & SOL on a market cap basis, we do think there is a high chance of one more run in BTC vs. the total market. Our logic is as follows:

1. The USA will likely announce some sort of \*mini\* reserve. Please don’t buy the 1M BTC purchase the moon boys are preaching. The USA has roughly 208,000 BTC or $21,424,000,000. _**The logical first step is to simply say they will not be selling them.**_ This does not mean they will go out and market buy 1M BTC

2. Texas, Japan and a ton of other large states/nations are considering reserves. Similar to our view on the USA policy we would think the same. Japan/Texas any other Sovereign/state grade actor is most likely going to start small or announce that they will simply keep the coins they have.

   1. For the OGs, remember Mt. Gox? Really doubt that all the coins were found/claimed and there is a good chance Japan will end up sitting on a nice sum
3. Saylor, despite his buying spree, is going to try and push the envelope with more 0% debt along with all the miners. This has been a massive price support for the past month now and will likely continue for at least another quarter or so (rough time frame)

4. Year end and 2025 marketing. Wall Street works in mysterious ways (joke). The ETFs were not really charging fees until the end of 2024. Now that they will earn on everything, expect another push for marketing (incentives). No one can perfectly predict this but we’d anticipate end of year and January to represent a heavy marketing push

**Add That All Up:** One of the important and true sayings on Wall Street is _“Buy the Rumor, Sell the News”._ Assuming some of the stuff that we expect happens (holding some coins as reserve and more Saylor buying) this will cause immense FOMO. **\*If\*** a modest reserve is announced, then people will **\*feel\*** like market purchases are coming from Nation States.

The important thing isn’t the announcement but rather people pricing in future massive purchases (moon boy fantasy - leverage comes in).

_**In short, that would suggest at least one more significant FOMO period for BTC.**_

While some alt coins will always beat BTC, _the majority,_ will likely bleed vs BTC.

As an example, a reserve or major Saylor raise causes BTC to go up 10% again, then alts likely go up 7-8% in aggregate but that is a bleed on the ratio during the excitement phase.

**BTC news is largely priced in if those four items occur.** People expect strategic reserves and nation states to bid. Good example scenarios below, a victory lap for the BTC maxis typically marks the start of alt season

### Then What

Our assumption is the Narrative shifts to ETH around Q1. As mentioned many times holding and farming with ETH requires conviction, since it is the only way to get more ETH without paying for it, we won’t consider selling until $6K+ **or** 0.053 ETH/BTC ratio at min. WSTEH has been a good example of what the opportunity cost was by allowing ETH to collect dust (around 15%).

In the background, _**a staking approval for ETH ETFs likely get filed within weeks of Gensler’s departure.**_

On January 20, we have Trump inauguration, Gensler out of the SEC and the ETF owners can then file to allow for staking for yield (or dividends in the TradFi world). We think it gets approved.

With a pro crypto admin it will be a tough sell to say no when it would directly hurt investors to deny it (no yield).

At that point, _**you open the door for a brand new set of investors called yield/dividend investors**_. Many funds are not allowed to own products with zero yield, that entire market would be allowed to market buy the ETFs and it would continue to grind higher, similar to the recent flows to end 2024.

### Summary

The higher BTC goes the higher the alts will go during mania phase. The majority will capitulate and sell. In fact, we think the majority of CT doesn’t even own BTC at this point - hence no excitement on the timeline.

Also. We’d wager that the majority of people actually hold less BTC and less ETH than they did in 2021 (yes seriously). People over trade, get emotional and will make the same mistakes since human psychology is a hard wired program.

**BTC ~ $140-160K in the cards, ETH above $6K+ is our expectation for now.**

Buying more BTC isn’t rational (emphasis - planning for 2025 unless an avid trader) because the risk has increased 4 fold since accumulating at around $25K on average in 2023. In 2024, the goal is to keep getting yield on ETH and controlling emotions as we wait for staking approval on the ETFs.

**Note on Downside:** Since people are on edge regarding prices, \*historically\* the next bear market goes to around the prior high of the bull market (tack on an extra 10%).

$69K peak went to $16-17K when the prior peak was $20K. Therefore, as a simple number in your head, your true \*never going to sell\* stack needs to sustain a drawdown to around $55-60K.

Said another way, look at all your crypto every month or so and ask yourself if this goes down to $55-60K will I be okay with that? Our risk tolerance is high, your risk tolerance may be lower.

## Part 2: Risk Assessments on Farms

As a simple rule of thumb you do not want to be farming when there are outflows. Remember that all of this is essentially cyber banking:

1. New farm opens (just like a bank) deposits flow in

2. The farm is safe because limited loans are out (just like a bank)

3. Money gets lent out

4. Then we have people withdrawing money to go to other farms (banks). They go to Arbitrum, OP, Hype (covered by DeFi Ed), Solana, Sui, Base etc. If money comes out, deposits go down

5. If deposits are leaving, risks of hacks/illiquidity go up significantly. Just like a bank, if deposits are low and there is a bank run, trouble is afoot. Incentives drive everything


### Current Farms

Right now, Symbiotic is still fine. However, we can make an argument that the vast majority of Blast projects now have outflow risk. A week ago we mentioned we will be leaving post vest but we’re going to actually pull a bit earlier.

We have multiple wallets on there but feel we need to send a message ahead of time so everyone on here knows we’re serious. If you stay on Juice through the vest there is around a 95% chance you’re safe. If you stay on Blast through vest you have around a 99% chance of being safe. If you pull a week before you have a 99.9999999% chance of being safe. We’ve got too much capital there, will not be messing around.

_**Autist Note:** You can use across protocol to bridge instantly for a small fee around 0.1%. This would avoid the 7 day wait. If you use the standard bridge you wait 7 days._

**Juice Balance Sheet**

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ec4ea6-d50b-4412-888e-1721bb74fa89_2658x1006.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ec4ea6-d50b-4412-888e-1721bb74fa89_2658x1006.png)

As you can see, risk is still very low. Only 933 ETH borrowed and 9,377 supplied. This is like having a bank with $3.7M in loans and deposits of $37.5M. Extremely liquid.

**Doing the Math:** Here is some good news. You probably already got the full year of value. If you were copying us it means you are lending ETH (that’s it no other dapp used). This means the points you are accruing have increased by ~15%. ETH was only at $3,300 towards the end of November (15% of 30 days is 4.5 days… close enough to 7 days).

Your points accrual by December 16-17 should actually get you close enough to the full vest **\*without\*** taking risk of being stuck in a 7 day queue with whales.

**Outflows:** On Dec 23/24 you’ll likely see a large number of people try to go farm other projects. While they might not be on Symbiotic they might go to HyperLiquid or AAVE or other platforms for yield.

At 1c per Blast the ROI is only about 8% (with dapp risk) and on top of that if there are outflows the token price likely goes down some 50%, making your ROI 4%. This doesn’t make sense anymore as you can get that elsewhere.

**Incentive Note on This:** The other major thing that people are not looking at is the incentive for the larger players. If you got 1/2 of the season 2 value and got 100% of your vest what is the point in staying for 6 additional months when we’re heading into a high probability alt season? You could buy NFTs, lend on other platforms to capture the high APY when people lever up or de-risk significantly by running your own node.

This is the main reason we think there will be outflows impacting both liquidity and token price. No announcements that encourage people to stay

**Options for the Money:** For now just get the process started, it takes about 7 days to get the funds back. This means you’ll have to wait, claim and then decide: 1) Symbiotic, 2) Morphos, 3) NFTs and 4) other alts like gaming/virtuals depending on your risk tolerance and knowledge base.

We’ll decide what we do around end of month. The key here is being out of the system before the rest of the whales try to move thousands of ETH off chain.

### Risk Assessment in 2025

Before we head into the new year, going to outline some general beliefs and risk reward ratio. You’re free to adjust if you don’t agree with the thesis:

**2025 Full Year - Assuming Large Size - 7+ Figures**

- ETH (farm, stake or use LIDO), we think is still best risk reward. If we get to middle of year and have to take the L we’re still probably going to hold. $6K+ seems engrained this cycle because: 1) only ETF besides BTC - BlackRock shut down other ideas and they get ~60% of all the flows, 2) think staking gets approved and people forgot they can refile after new chair, 3) much lower emissions this year - no unlocks and largely flattish supply vs. old mid single digit inflation and 4) Coinbase will press hard to get people on BASE. We rotated some BTC into it at around 0.053 around Dec/Nov last year and won’t be rotating until at least 0.053+ on ETH/BTC ratio **or** if it hits $6K+

- BTC, near term it’s a healthy to hold in size. More rumors that end up being true between now and March. After that though, probably close to done vs. Alts

- SOL - lowest right now due to unlocks. If you’re on the Galaxy deal (many of you are) think you’re going to be set on SOL exposure for life


**DeGen Plays Full Year - Assuming Medium Size**

- High-grade NFTs. We’re assuming $150K is small/medium size. This means a Punk will do fine. Anything top 5-10 will likely trend up as they are status signals

  - _Bonus:_ think about airdrops. If Milady and Penguins have already dropped, Yuga Labs would more likely drop to PUNKS/BAYC before anything else
- For the ballers on here (there are quite a bit) EtherRocks as mentioned likely go up the problem is they are more illiquid


**DeGen Plays Full Year - Assuming Small Size**

- _Grail Memes:_ WIF, PEPE, DOGE and MOG - no particular order at this point. When PEPE ran last time buy the others and vice versa. Hype ecosystem (covered by DeFi Ed)

- _Grail Narratives:_ RWA, DeFi, Virtuals - these are the three ones. Carve out a niche in one of these, spray and pray.


**Avoid**

- XRP as you know is centralized dangerous to touch

- L2 coins - while you can farm and drop them, at best they have held value. Even ARB isn’t at AirDrop prices


As usual, all of this is subject to change during 2025 but that’s how we see it today. If you own a large amount of ETH/BTC have a couple quality NFTs and try to carve out a niche in the DeGen area we think you’ll be happy with the results. Mania season is likely coming

* * *

## Part 3: Various Updates

### Trump Alpha

In the 4th year, you can try to trade a bit. This is the only time we think it is rational to do so, everything goes up. We now have clear proof that when Trump’s wallet buys something the token goes up enough to justify instant buys and sells.

Set up a tracker dedicated to WorldFi and do exactly that _**if you have time**_. We’re entering the phase where people will send random tokens to the address to try and create hype. Be sure that you’re watching purchases not people sending various coins to the doxxed address. Here is the info on that ( **[source](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/worldlibertyfi)**). The inverse is also true, if it sells an alt, that alt likely goes down 10-15% as well.

### RWA To Heat Up

We’re still going to keep a chunk of our ONDO but per the protocol, 99% of you should just sell the principal and free roll it. There is a lock-up coming in January and BlackRock has to market the ETH narrative before they market the RWA narrative.

Tomorrow we’re going to publish a free post on a small RWA coin. We own a \*tiny\* amount of it so giving you guys a heads up now. **The post will go out at 9PM EST on Monday.** Since it is small if the coin runs a lot we’ll have to decide if the market cap was too small to write about. Market cap is fine but volume is low so this will be a decent test of what we should and shouldn’t write about here. (also if bots are still scraping the free posts)

_TL;DR RWA narrative likely picks up after ETH marketing by BlackRock so still worth researching._

### Virtuals

Still driving good narrative as they are displacing meme coin attention despite being meme coins. In our head, the top memes are safer and then Virtuals would be higher risk vs. that.

When the issuance slows down the token will have the reverse effect. It will start going down quickly (similar to it going up quickly). If Virtuals end up lasting the entire 2025 it’ll basically cannibalize the SOL meme eco of Pump dot Fun.

### Leveraging

Outside of what we’re seeing with BTC in the traditional financial system we don’t see a lot of crazy leverage yet. While a billion or two in liquidations seems large, have to go back to 2021 and look at how nutty it got. LUNA was a top coin and “consensus” and we haven’t really had any Re-staking hype.

Re-staking hype likely kicks off more assuming ETH ETF staking gets approved. Think of it of an if-then shift. If ETH staking gets approved we’ll likely move more money into re-staking outside of the standard farms we’re on.

## Summary

Lots of stuff but in summary

- BTC probably has another leg up but we don’t think anyone here needs to add since they have built it in 2023. Higher BTC goes = better Alt Season

- ETH won’t be touching unless $6K+ or 0.053 ETH/BTC (roughly) since that would mean 100% of farming rewards are free rolled

- SOL still can’t justify buying due to GLXY exposure

- High grade NFTs likely undervalued, most not bullish on it and we doubt Yuga labs allows all of the top ones to fail

- Choose memes or narratives: AI/RWA/Gaming if you’re all over telegram/wechat/discord you’ll be able to scratch the degen itch without getting paved


**On that note, stay toon’d!**

As a small warning we’ll probably take one day off this year. We haven’t really done one the entire time writing and Christmas day looks ideal. Knowing we just wrote that out, good chance something crazy happens but that’s the plan!
